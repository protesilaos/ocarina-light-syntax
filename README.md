# Ocarina syntax theme (light version)

> It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.

*Ocarina* is a medium contrast theme loosely inspired by *The Legend of Zelda* video game series. It has been created as a tribute to Zelda's 30th anniversary.

Its most prevalent colours are variations of green, cyan, orange, yellow, and violet.

*Ocarina* comes in standalone light and dark versions (see further info below).

*The font is [Iosevka term slab](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)*.  
*JavaScript demo is source code of [prismjs](http://prismjs.com/)*  
*The UI is my experimental fork of the default One Dark*.
